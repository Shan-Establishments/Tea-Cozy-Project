# Tea Cozy Project üçµ
I created a fictional tea shop website off of the [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path) platform. I did this to test my CSS flex skills and display layout. 

### What did I learn?
From this project solely, I learned how to:
+ Wrap images using the flex properties and values.
+ How to use fixed values appropriately.
+ How to align items and text

### What programming lanuages did I use?
This project was created via HTML and CSS.

### Why is this project unique?
What makes this project stand out is how I managed to display the images on the webpage. I managed to display an image logo, I was able to make the main title of webpage stand out in front of another image and I was able to group images togather giving them a caption. The contrast with the black background and the colourfull images makes the website unique as a whole. Plus the light font with the dark background colour makes the webpage easily readable.

This is an image of my website so far:
